HW7 Mbed-DSP programming
===========================
## Lab Instruction
Design a DSP program using Mbed Studio or Mbed CLI to process the sensor data of 3D accelerators or gyroscopes from STM32 IOT Node development board.
(1) The DSP program can implement a low pass filter, like FIR example, or other algorithms, such as FFT, etc.
(2) Before testing real data, you should test the program using a known signal to show the correctness.

## Project brief
We use DSP program to process the data of 3D accelerators at x-direction.
