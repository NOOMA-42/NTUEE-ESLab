HW5 PWM and Logic Analyzer
===========================
## Lab Instruction
Please read some information about PWM techniques and applications in Internet resources (such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation, https://electricalfundablog.com/pulse-width-modulation/, ...) and find an application that you are interested in. And generate the PWM waveforms for the applications, which can be observed using a logic analyzer. Show some waveform observations in the report.

Submission.
1. Mbed Studio projects (in github)
2. A report about your lab steps and discussions.

## Project brief
We tailored a PWM signal and read it with logic analyzer. We had Mbed and LED connected through the board alongside with the logic analyzer.

## Installation Instruction
1. Git pull
2. Prepare board and zeroplus logic analyzer LAP-C(16128) and connect with Mbed
3. Run following code.

## Device Requirements
1. Mbed DISCO-L4755VG-IOT01A
2. logic analyzer LAP-C(16128)

## Sample Outpu
